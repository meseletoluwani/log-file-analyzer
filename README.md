# Log Analyzer

A validation and testing engineer did a manual run for a series of tests for the 
new feature that your startup is planning to include with the next release of 
the product.

For each executed test, the engineer produced test result as follows:

```
Test Type: <type> Result: <pass/fail> Description: <description>
```

With test type being one of 'Performance', 'Functional', or 'System'. You can
see sample test result logs in the `result_logs` folder.

After running the list of tests, the engineer noticed that running more tests
will make it more challenging to provide a statistical report for the managers.

Your task is to help generate an automatic report for test statistics, based on
the log files. Another engineer has started writing a program to automate the 
reporting, but there are two functions left to write.

## Your Task

Your program will take the path to a log file as input. It should analyze the 
file for the following:

- Number of executed tests
- How many tests where the description contains the word 'component'
- Most used type of test
- The number of failures for each type of test

The starter code drives the logic of the program in a function called 
`analyze_logs`. It takes a test log file (a string) as input and return a 
string with the analysis. Your task is to complete the helper functions required
for finding the most used test type and counting the number of failures for each
type of test.

## Starter Code

The starter code in `log_analyzer.py` has most of the `analyze_log` function and 
helper functions built out. It also has code to read a file and run the analysis
when the program is run from the command line. When running the program, you 
can pass in an input file, and an optional output file to write the results.

Examples:
```
python log_analyzer.py result_logs/test_results.log

python log_analyzer.py result_logs/test_results_3.log statistics_output.txt
```

## Expected Results

The output for your program should look like this:

```
Number of tests: 15
Most used type of tests: Performance
Tests related to "component": 10

Failures:
Type            Count
Performance     5
System          6
Functional      8

```

## Testing

First, run your program manually to check that the output makes sense. Pass in
some of the files in the `result_logs/` folder to check that the output matches
what you expect.

Then, run the automated tests to confirm that your solution is correct.
